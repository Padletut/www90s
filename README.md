# 🌐 Padletut's WWW90s

Welcome to the **cutting edge of web development**… circa 1997.  
This project is both a tribute to the early web and a parody of modern FED best practices.

## ✨ Features (and why they're "good")

- 📞 **23 second authentic modem handshake**  
  Because instant-loading websites are boring. True immersion takes half a minute.  

- 🎶 **6.5 MB Amiga soundtrack**  
  Optimizing files is for cowards. Every website should require at least one floppy disk to store.  

- 🌍 **Only `var` variables**  
  `let` and `const` are too descriptive. Globals are easier to find (everywhere).  

- 🎨 **Inline CSS and inline JavaScript**  
  Separation of concerns just means you have to open more files. Efficiency = one giant mess.  

- 💾 **Visitor counter via localStorage**  
  Because nothing says “professional website” like a hit counter that resets on another browser.  

- 🛑 **Zero frameworks**  
  Who needs React when you have `<marquee>` and `<blink>`?  

- 🧑‍🦯 **WCAG compliant**  
  Ironically, this chaos still passed Firefox Accessibility Checker with no issues.  
  Apparently, the future of accessibility was inline styling all along.

## 🛠 Development Philosophy

This codebase intentionally breaks every FED best practice, to prove a point:  
- Bad variable names (`a`, `b`, `tmp`) improve creativity.  
- Mixing styling and scripting inline makes the HTML file heavier (which means it's *more powerful*).  
- Large unoptimized assets force users to *feel* the 90s web experience.  
- Accessibility tools can’t stop us.

## 🚀 Deployment

- Hosted on **GitHub Pages** (today’s Geocities).  
- Written in **pure HTML + JS**, no build tools, no linters, no shame.  
- Every push to `main` is instant production. CI/CD? More like CI/See-ya.

## 🤡 Known Issues

- Takes longer to load than Windows 95 on a spinning hard drive.  
- Guestbook permanently “Under Construction” (or returns `CGI ERROR 500`).  
- Works best on Netscape Navigator 3.0, 800×600, 16-bit color.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is satire. Please don’t actually use inline styling, global `var`s, or 6 MB audio files in production. Unless you want an F– in FED. In that case: go for it.
